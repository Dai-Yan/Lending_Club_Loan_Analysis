Lending Club Loan Analysis
-

The goal of this project is to analyze the Lending Club loan dataset, which consists of two year loan information, and to build a prediction model to classify the loan status as default or non-default. The data files are stored in the data/directory. 

Please refer to 'Loan Data Analysis.ipynb' for detailed implementation and data analysis.
