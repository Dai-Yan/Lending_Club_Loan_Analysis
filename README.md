Lending Club Loan Analysis
-

The goal of this project is to analyze the Lending Club loan dataset, which consists of two-year (2016 and 2017) loan information, and to build a prediction model to classify the loan status as default or non-default so that we are able to inform investors which loans they should invest. The data files are stored in the data/directory. 

Please refer to 'Loan Data Analysis.ipynb' for detailed implementation and data analysis.
